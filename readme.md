## Features

### üîç **User Interface**
- **Multi-Token Search**: Enter multiple Solana token addresses to search.
- **Wallet Metrics**: View detailed wallet data:
  - Volume
  - Profit and Loss (PNL)
  - Transaction Count
- **Sorted Results**:
  - Wallets ranked by PNL.
  - Number of tokens matching your search criteria.
- **Interactive Insights**: Click on a wallet to explore its detailed metrics and transaction history.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**
- **Helius API Integration**: Fetches on-chain Solana transaction data.
- **Exchange Filtering**: Removes known exchange wallets to focus on individual trader activity.
- **Data Caching**: Uses PostgreSQL to cache transaction data for faster performance.
- **PNL Analysis**: Calculates profit and loss by analyzing buy/sell transactions.

### üöÄ **Key Features**
- **Multi-Token Search**: Discover wallets interacting with multiple tokens in one query.
- **Exchange Filtering**: Focus on wallets belonging to individual traders, not exchanges.
- **Transaction History**: Complete transaction logs for each wallet.
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyze:
  - Volume traded
  - PNL
  - Token overlap count with your search

## How It Works
1. **Enter Token Addresses**: Input Solana token addresses in the search bar.
2. **View Wallets**: See a sorted list of wallets interacting with these tokens.
3. **Explore Metrics**: For each wallet, view its:
   - Total volume
   - PNL
   - Number of transactions
   - Overlap with searched tokens
4. **Interactive Analysis**: Click on a wallet for a detailed breakdown of its transaction history and metrics.

- **Backend**: 
  - Helius API for on-chain data retrieval.
  - PostgreSQL for caching and performance optimization.
  - PNL calculations based on transaction history.
- **Sorting Logic**: Rank wallets based on:
  - PNL
  - Token overlap count
